Project Name: ServerSage

Below is a basic outline of the PHP script that accomplishes the requirements for the ServerSage tool:

Setup and Configuration:

Create a MySQL database to store server and user information.
Implement user registration and login functionality using PHP sessions.
Use PDO for database interactions to prevent SQL injection.
Dashboard and Server Overview:

Upon login, users are redirected to the dashboard displaying an overview of registered servers.
Display server status indicators (online/offline), resource usage, and uptime.
Implement utilization charts using libraries like Chart.js to visualize server resources (CPU, memory).
Server Management:

Allow users to add, remove, and edit servers from the tool.
Provide an option to register specific services (HTTP, FTP, SSH) running on each server.
Remote Server Management:

Implement functionalities for remote server management tasks, such as server restart, service restart, and file management.
Use SSH (securely with proper authentication) to execute remote commands on the servers.
Periodic Server Monitoring:

Set up a cron job to periodically check server status (ping, port availability) and update the dashboard.
Use ICMP ping and port scanning to check server availability and service status.
Server Resource Usage:

Utilize SNMP or SSH to retrieve server resource usage data (CPU, memory) from the registered servers.
Visualize this data on the dashboard alongside other server details.
Idempotency:

Design the management tasks to be idempotent, meaning they can be safely repeated without adverse effects.
Error Handling:

Implement proper error handling for database queries and server communications.
Log errors for debugging purposes.
Database Table Verification:

On application start, check if the required database table exists.
If the table exists, display a message indicating that the database table is ready to receive task input.
If the table doesn't exist, create it.
User Authentication:

Protect access to the tool by requiring users to authenticate before accessing the dashboard or management features.
Use secure password hashing and salting techniques.
